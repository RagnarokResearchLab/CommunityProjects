# Community Projects Mirror

This repository contains various projects created and published by the RO community.

## Goals

Many old projects have become difficult to find due to the passage of time (dead links, obscure forum posts, buried in spam, ...). Since they may still be of interest to researchers, this repository attempts to aggregate them.

## Checkout Notice

Make sure to check out the repository *recursively* since it uses [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RagnarokResearchLab/CommunityProjects.git --recursive
```

## Licensing Information

This repository contains no actual code. All community projects have first been published by their respective authors.

The original license terms still apply. For details, please consult the individual projects' README or LICENSE file (etc).

## Contributing

If you know of (or have created) a project that isn't listed here, please add it! :)
